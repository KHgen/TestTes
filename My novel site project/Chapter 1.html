<h2 style="text-align: center;">CHAPTER 1</h2>
<p>I'm a 40 year old man who is a soldier serving his country full time.</p>
    <p> have a wife and 2 kids, one boy and one girl.</p>
    <p>Today I had been given a week's rest from a gruesome civil war with some rebels who are opposing the government in which a lot of people had been killed from both sides.</p>
    <p>I myself had killed a few hundred and the people on camp had given me the nickname 'Killing machine' but they are right after all, I had killed a lot of people throughout my life in the military and hadn't felt an ounce of regret. It was like I didn't have emotions probably a result of me not growing up with my parents and living in an orphanage and even there I couldn't make any friends and I fought a lot. I was feared by the kids in the adoption center as a result.</p>  
    <p>I haven't really felt feelings that most human felt and even when I got married my expression was solemn, it was probably because it was an arranged marriage between some one who wanted to get rid of me from the orphanage and I wasn't there for my kids birth and I didn't feel anything. The closest thing I got to human feeling was a little thrill I had from reading fantasy novels and that was when I read it to my kid. I would also read it myself sometimes if I donâ€™t have anything to do.</p>
    <p>I was heading home and wanted to buy some presents to my family, I hadn't seen them in all most 3 years.</p>
    <p>I picked out some things for them that I thought they would like at random and went to the apartment that the government had given soldiers for there services. Although it wasn't very spacious it was enough for my family to live in since they were only 3.</p>
    <p>I opened the door and went in but the room was dark. Maybe they're asleep I thought. I headed to my bedroom to check on my wife but when I went there, it was empty. I checked the kids room but it was also empty. I thought they had gone out to buy somethings and decided to wait for them. 2 hours passed but they didn't come back.</p>
    <p>I decided to look for them and when I was heading out I saw one of my neighbors'. She saw me and asked if I was the owner of this house. I nodded and she asked me to wait for her and went inside her house. Some time later she got out of the house and handed me a letter.</p>
    <p>I looked at it in confusion and asked her who gave her this and she told me that my wife had given her this letter a year ago and asked her to give me this whenever I came back.</p>
    <p>I opened it and read it to myself and in conclusion it said that she had left me because I wasn't there for her and the kids.</p>
    <p>I thought I needed to feel something but I felt nothing.</p>
    <p>The next 6 days I was thinking of my purpose in life, the whole reason I became a soldier was to get some money to help my wife and kids live on it. I thought it was mandatory for them to have money but I didn't need it, I wouldn't have minded living in poverty because that's how I lived most of my life. I wouldn't have minded dying from hunger if I was alone but when I got married I thought it was mandatory to feed my wife and the kids but now I didn't have any motive to work.</p>
    <p>The next day I returned to camp and continued my work still wondering about my purpose in life. I started spacing out and my moves started getting sluggish. A week later we heard news that the rebel army was moving again and we needed to prepare for war and 2 days later we were attacked. Everybody got ready to fight and started wearing armor and getting their gears.</p>
    <p>I was stationed in the frontlines and I could hear gunshots everywhere. I killed 10 or so people and wondered about my purpose in life while standing on the battle field and that gave one of the enemies a chance to shoot me. I dodged but it inflicted damage on my leg and my moves became very slow and my accuracy decreased and that gave the enemy a chance but this time instead of one enemy, 5 or so surrounded me and I tried to fight back but to no avail. One of them shot me in the back and a barrage of gun shots came at me. I deduced it was the end but something I haven't felt all my life came over me, it was my first ever feeling, 'FEAR', it was fear of death, it wasn't the best time to unlock my feelings but I did, and I wanted a second chance to feel this feelings a little more but my eyes started closing slowly and I couldn't fell all my body parts.</p>
    <p>I started seeing an endless black void but I saw something after some time of wandering the void, light. I followed the light and I could feel my eyes again and when I opened them, I could see a women holding me.</p>
