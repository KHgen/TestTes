<h2 align="center">CHAPTER 2</h2>
<p>A woman was looking at me and smiling. She had blonde hair and blue eyes and she looked like she was in her 30's.</p>
    
    <p>Huh, what's going on? Didn't I just die? Where is this place and who is she? I questioned myself. I tried to spring up because I thought I was lying on something but I couldn't.</p>
    
    <p>I tried to move my hand but except for some feeling in my fingers I couldn't move. Was I paralyzed? No, that can't be it because I died, or I thought I died. Did someone save me?</p>
    
    <p>The woman still smiling said something and looked to her left, I couldn't understand what she said but I wanted to know what she was looking at so I turned my head to where she was looking at.</p>
    
    <p> Turning my head seemed to be the hardest thing I ever did but I did it. I saw a man smiling at me. He had grey eyes and black hair and he seemed to be in his 30's as well.</p>
    
    <p>What is going on? I wondered. This was weird. I had probably died, so I shouldn't be here. I couldn't understand what these people were saying though I was hearing them say things, and I couldn't control my body and even if I did it was very hard to do it and these people seemed like they were happy about something and seemed to be a couple because of their appearances and age.</p>
    
    <p>As I was thinking about this, I heard a sound which sounded like a door opening. I forcibly turned my head and saw a girl about 4 or 5 years old get in.</p>
    
    <p>She said something to the pair smiling at me and the woman smiled at her and put her on her lap.</p>
    
    <p>-------------------</p>
    
    <p>Weeks passed after this confusing scenario but I understood what was going on. I had experienced something called reincarnation. It’s when a person dies and is transported to another as an infant, and it’s mostly to fantasy worlds (I know this through the fantasy novels I read to my kids).</p>
    
    <p>These past weeks I discovered that the three people who I first saw were my family. My mother Lora Ashford, my father Gale Ashford, and my older sister Elara Ashford. I had been named Kael Ashford and I had been showered with love these past weeks and it seems that because they talked in that foreign language and talked a lot to me, the language came to me naturally although that didn't mean I could talk, just that I could understand it. I had my father's hair and my mother's eyes while my face features were different from them.</p>
    
    <p>My mother and sister didn't leave my side and said how cute I was and how I would grow up to be and showed me a lot of love. My father also showered me with love when he was home from work. He was something called a mage. A mage was someone who could use magic and not just some magic like on Earth that magicians do, but real magic that included controlling elements and healing abilities, and there are also other types of magic that are restricted to some races. His work was to help farmers by watering their plants and he also did some other work suited for a mage like adventuring, a job where people traveled and did work that something called guilds give them, like a guarding job for important people or hunting down monsters. My father didn't do much traveling because he had a family so he only hunted monsters which were the source of meat in this village. Though he still does them if they are needed.</p>
    
    <p>I always felt some strange warmth in my heart when one my family members smiled at me. I think it was happiness and it was weird and foreign, but it was very comforting. This was the first feeling I felt in this world, the only other time I felt a feeling was when I died and it seems that feeling had unlocked all my feelings, but I need something to stimulate them.</p>
    
    <p>Although it was weird that my parents were younger than me, I didn't mind it. I actually was happy that I had parents who cared for me because I didn't have that kind of care and love I had right now in my past life. I know I accepted this easily but it was actually easy for me to accept it.</p>
    
    <p>My sister Elara had learned basic magic from dad and would sometimes show me the spells that she learned. For a person to conjure a spell they need two things, mana and the incantation. Although it was rare, some people didn't have mana and unfortunately, I didn't have mana. But instead of mana these people had abilities designated for them that appeared between the ages of 3 and 5, but there are some very unlucky people who don't have both abilities and mana.</p>
    
    <p>I was actually excited to practice magic but when I heard that I couldn't I was a little sad but I was also happy because I could experience these two emotions after all I had made a goal to experience emotions to the fullest but that may be a bad idea.</p>
     
    <p>------------------</p>
    
    <p>Half a year passed and yesterday I had just started to crawl. It was very frustrating not being able to use my body parts as I wanted but that had at least decreased, and I had some control over my body but I still couldn't control my body functions.</p>
    
    <p>Today was Ela's birthday and my mom wanted to have a birthday party so she was going out to the shop to get some things and she decided to take me with her. This was my first time getting out of the house so I wanted to study my surroundings.</p>
    
    <p>We lived in a village called Rivenwood. It was a modest village nestled by a serene river. The air was fresh and filled with the scent of blooming flowers and pine. The houses were simple, built from wood and stone, and the people here lived an easy life, almost like the countryside in my old world.</p>
    
    <p>As my mother carried me through the village, I saw children playing, merchants selling their goods, and farmers tending to their crops. I also saw my father watering the plants by a spell that seemed to make some water rain down in a designated location. As soon as he saw us he smiled and waved at us and some other people who knew my mother also waved at us.</p>
    
    <p>Sometime later we reached the marketplace, and my mother began picking out various items for the party. I watched how she interacted with the villagers, her warm smile and kind words making everyone around her happy. It was then that I realized the true power of emotions—how they could connect people, bring joy, and create bonds.</p>
    
    <p>I saw some people carrying weapons and just roaming around, I thought they were adventurers and I was fascinated by their build and how they were in groups. I wanted to actually be an adventurer.</p>
    
    <p>When my mother was shopping I discovered what people used to buy and sell things using coins. There were three types of coins: Copper, silver and gold. Gold was the highest out of these three and 1 piece of a gold coin could probably last a family of four, like ours for weeks.</p>
    
    <p>My mother finished up what she needed to buy and as we made our way back home, I couldn't help but feel excited about the future. I had a loving family, a beautiful village, and a chance to experience life in a way I never had before. The journey of discovering my emotions had just begun, and I was ready to embrace it.</p>
    
    <p>That evening, we celebrated Elara's birthday. The house was filled with laughter, delicious food, and the warmth of family. I watched as Elara opened her presents, her eyes sparkling with joy. My father performed a small magic show, conjuring colorful lights and illusions that left us all in awe.</p>
    
    <p>As the night drew to a close, I felt a deep sense of contentment. This new world, this new life, was a gift. And I was determined to make the most of it.</p>
