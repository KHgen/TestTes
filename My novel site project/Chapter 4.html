                <p align="center"> BETT’S POV<br>
                     ********************</p>
<p>My name is Bett Lucidea, a knight of a kingdom known as the kingdom of Instasia.</p>

<p>I was doing my duties as usual when my sister showed up. That was a few days back. She said that she needed me to teach her child swordsmanship. Well just combat but I thought it was swordsmanship because that was the only type of combat I knew. Hmm… her son, eh?. Oh yeah, she sent me a letter that she had a son about 3 years ago didn’t she.</p>

<p>Well anyway, because there wasn’t any wars and things I needed to do, I accepted. I also wanted to see my nephew.</p>

<p>After two days(one for getting ready and one for travelling), we arrived at Rivenwood after all the kingdom and Rivenwood were very close. We went to the house of my sister and I saw a boy who was throwing rocks. My sister had already filled me about his ability and I guess he was practicing that.</p>

<p>His name was Kael Ashford and he was a cute little kid with his father’s hair and his mother’s eyes. That night I met with the other members of the family and we decided to start combat training tomorrow. Oh and it seemed that Ela wanted to join in as well although it would have been better for her to learn more about magic from her dad rather than fighting, she wanted to know how different people use magic in combat.</p>

<p>The next day we started training, I prepared 3 wooden swords that we would use for training and gave Kael and Ela one each and took the other one for myself. I made Kael’s sword a very short one considering he was about 4 years old.</p>

<p>I thought about teaching them the basics of swordsmanship for the first week together then, I would train them separately. I would teach Kael some basics of combat and change to actual combat when he becomes five years old while I would teach Ela how to fight with magic and a sword. Although Kael was very little to learn actual combat, learning and developing an ability will help the person to be able to master his ability and use it to its full potential, or so the doctor said.</p>

<p>As so the first week passed in a flash. We trained 3 hour a day and I was actually surprised about the performance of Kael. For a 4 year old he was a genius. Although his sister got hang of the basics before him, it was only a difference of some hours. They got hang if the basics on the fifth day after we started training so, I told them to rest and get ready for the next week training.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p>Today was the start of the second week of training day. My sister had taken Ela to the shop so I was gonna train Kael alone today. First we started by testing how his ability would work in fighting. We asked Gale to make us a weak training dummy using earth magic(He was spectating us) and we tested out how many hits it would take him to make the dummy crack. At my signal he started attacking the dummy. He was only attacking one place and after 5 hits the dummy cracked. Although the goal of the training had been accomplished I asked Kael to continue attacking the dummy until it broke. He attacked the same spot once again and after two hits the dummy break into two two halves.</p>

<p>After that we sat down to know what happened and maybe understand more about his ability to help us for the training of the coming days.</p>

<p>“So, Kael, tell me what you saw and why you attacked that one spot only” I asked</p>

<p>“Well, when I thought about attacking the dummy, I saw 3 places that I thought I should attack. Two of them were glowing yellow while the other one was glowing red. I thought I should attack the red one because it was different than the other two. I did and it broke”</p>

<p>Ah so that’s why he attacked that one spot I thought.</p>

<p>With the information he gave me I thought of something. The three spots he saw were probably the weak points of the dummy. They glowed differently according to what an attack would do to them. We tried this with two other dummies and another color showed up: Green. With this I devised the colors as the following.</p>

<p>Red- The most critical point.<br>
Yellow- Critical but would probably take twice more as hits as the red points to deal the same damage.<br>
Green- Better than attacking blindly</p>

<p>I told Kael about it and it seemed that he understood.As so I concluded this day’s training because this information was enough for the day. Ela and Lora returned some time later and the day ended without nothing major happening.</p>

                     <p align="center">KAEL’S POV<br>

                  *************************</p>    

<p>It has been quite sometime since my aunt became my teacher. A year passed, hasn’t it? I had trained for a year continuously to hone my skills and develop my ability and my training was showing fruit. I had become able to use my ability in a flexible manner. I had also been having duels with my aunt and my dad because my aunt thought that it would help me if I fought against a person.</p> 

<p>I was also nearing the age of 5 which seemed to be a big deal in these world and so was the age of 10 and 15. Elara was also nearing 10 wasn’t she? Anyway today was my rest day and my father said that I should go with him to the farm. I didn’t know why he needed me for but I followed.</p>

<p>The farm was close to our house so we arrived rather quickly. As we arrived we noticed that some people were gathered around a specific area. My father went in the small crowd and I followed him in. They seemed to be discussing something and my father interrupted by saying, “Did it happen again?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, this is the eighth time this happened this week only” said one of the farmers.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what happened so I thought what was on the ground would give me an idea. When I saw what was on the ground it was some crops laying on the ground as if something sucked them out. That gave me an idea why my father had brought me here. When I got my ability for the first time, the doctor had said that I could see details that others could miss so, maybe that was why my father had brought me here.</p>

<p>“Kael..” said my father and stopped, Yeah my guess is probably right</p>

<p>“.…Sorry but can you wait out there, I was thinking it would be a good bonding time for us if we spent the day together but it seems like I can’t because of this problem.”</p>

<p>Huh? Didn’t he bring me here to ask me to help him. Well guess I wasn’t correct. Hmm?….What the… I was smiling, although it was faint I was smiling. Probably because I saw that my father had cared for me and wasn’t trying to use me. But still… I should help him, right?</p>

<p>“But dad, I can help.” I said. My father turned around with a puzzled look on his face. “Remember what the doctor said, I can see details that others could miss” I continued.</p>

<p>My father put his hand on his chin and started thinking as if trying to remember. “Hmm..Okay, but don’t stress yourself okay” he said while kneeling down and looking at me with a worried face on his face.</p>

<p>Let’s get this on the first try and go have some bonding time I thought.</p>

<p>I turned to the plant and looked down on it trying to find something. I checked it surroundings for some time and I saw something near the plant. A weed. I pointed at it and my father took it out.</p>

<p>“What’s this? I have never seen a weed like this” the weed was a big one and had some kind of purple color near its root. “It has also mana flowing through it, seems like it is absorbing the mana and minerals from the soil and it seems to be in an absurd rate seeing how much its grown”</p>

<p>Hmmm?…. It seems like the soil in this world doesn’t have only minerals but also some mana inside of it. That explains why the fruits and vegetables looked a bit different. This told me that I didn’t know a lot of things about this world.</p>

<p>“Well men, go and take out all the weeds you see, I hope that will solve this problem. And try not to miss them.” after saying that he turned around to me and said, “Well thanks Kael, I’m gonna help the farmers and we will have some time together later.” saying that he turned back around and went into the farms. I sat down on a near rock and watched him work. I used to do some farm work to get cash as a soldier so it was kinda refreshing to see people do farm work.</p>

<p>The day went by and me and my father had some bonding time(I guess) as he told me stories of his recent escort job. Anyways it wasn’t that bad of a day as I saw how my father cared for me and I discovered one of the attributes of my ability( Even though I think some other person would have found the weed anyways).</p>
