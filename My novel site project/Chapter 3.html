<h2 align="center">CHAPTER 3</h2>
<p>Three years passed in a flash without any notable things happening. Maybe one that I think should be noted was the feeling of belonging that I experienced on my first birthday. It was a little celebration and it was in a lot of ways similar to Elara’s fifth birthday. And another thing to note was I started to read and write using this world’s language.</p>
 
<p>Right now I am 3 years old and was eagerly waiting for my ability because it should appear in the age between three to five. It wasn’t exactly known when an ability would appear but it had symptoms that showed it was near and I had started feeling them for sometime now. The symptoms included, being tired a lot, high heat and occasionally some vomiting, it was generally a combination of the symptoms of a cold and stomach pain.</p> 
 
<p>This past few days I had been reading some books in the house that described a lot of things about this world and here are some things I learned this past few days.</p> 
 
<p>This world was a place that every race used to live in together but, approximately 2000 years ago a fight happened between the 10 strongest fighter in the world, they were called ‘THE 10 JADES‘. The reason for the dispute wasn’t known but the 10 divided into two groups with five warriors on each side. There was no clear winner but the fight had divided the world in 6 parts. Thus, the world had been divided into six continents ; the human continent, the demon continent, the elf continent, the dwarf continent, the sky continent and the central continent. In most of the novels I read to my kids and myself; dwarfs, elfs and humans lived together in the same continent but in this world they lived in different continents. Every continent except the sky continent and the central continent, as their name implies tells what lives on them.</p>

<p>The sky continent, as its name implies, was a continent on the sky and its inhabitants were dragons. Well not really dragons but they were dragon people or as most people call them ‘Dragon folk’.</p>

<p>The central continent, as its name also implies was the continent in the center of the other continents. It was the continent that anyone from the other continents could go into without permission. Simply put it was a continent where no race was abundant.</p>

<p>Although the central continent is where different races usually meet, you could go to other continents as well(But permission is needed) but most people don’t because they think they would be discriminated on although humans, elves and dwarfs don’t really do that to each other because they looked like each other but still, most people only go to the central continent. As for me, I wanted to see every continent in this world, I actually want to adventure very much, it seemed like it was my passion.</p>

<p>All of these continents except the central continent had rulers. King and queens were common in the human,elf and dwarf continent while there were demon kings in the demon continent(although they were few). The sky continents ruler was based on power so the strongest was the leader and so it would change frequently.</p>

<p>Well that was the gist of what I got.</p>

<p>A few days passed and the symptoms of the ability coming had stopped so I thought I had gotten my ability. My parents who saw that my symptoms have stopped took me to a near doctor that would tell me what my ability was. These doctor was also someone who has an ability and his ability was recognition. He was an elf that was a former adventurer. He travelled through the central continent to make it here and so he had some experience with abilities.</p>

<p>We sat on a chair and faced the doctor. The doctor looked at me and a few moments later he said, “Hmm…. I have discovered the ability of your child but I am afraid that I have to test something out before telling you what it is.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked my father</p> 

<p>“Oh its nothing, just a quick test to check something, there is nothing wrong with Kael, I can assure you that ” saying that the doctor guided us outside to a field and he brought a table put it on the field then put an apple on top of it and gave me a rock.</p>

<p>“Kael please aim at the apple and throw the rock with all the strength you have” he said.</p>

<p>I didn’t what this was for but I knew it was just to check my ability so I nodded. When I started aiming for the apple I saw something appear on the apple, it was circular and looked like what you see on a gun when using the zoom on it, it was pointing at the center of the apple so I thought that’s where I should throw the rock to. I was a good shooter in my past life so I aimed for the apple and threw the rock as hard as I can.</p>

<p>The rock flew through the air, straight to the apple with incredible speed. It hit the apple dead center, splitting it into two perfect halves. Everyone around me, including myself was amazed except for the doctor that is. He smiled a little and clapped his hands as he had been expecting this. "Impressive Kael, it seems that you have an ability called 'Precision Sight'. Sorry for the sudden test, I was just checking what this ability was like because I haven't seen an ability with this kind of name in my travels"</p>

<p>After that he told us that the reason why he had given me this test was because his ability couldn't tell him what this ability's characteristics was. He told us that his ability only recognizes and explains about things that the world knew about. For example if he was out gathering food from plants and was checking if they were safe or not there would be some cases when he would only see the name of the plant and not if it was poisonous or not, that was probably because this plant hadn't been discovered yet by the world and that was what had happened with my ability, it only showed him its name not what it does so he wanted to test it out. He told us that if he knew even one or two things about the ability, his own ability will give him most of the information automatically.</p>

<p>"Well that was why I had given you a test. Ok now to the matter on hand. Your ability is called 'Precision Sight'. It is a new ability the world had never seen before. In a word it is a unique ability right now. Continuing I had discovered somethings about this ability but you should know that it is very fewl. This is the first time I had this kind of small information so I will tell you what I know now and you have to find out the rest by yourself </p>

<p>"So this ability can be used in something's, one of them is for combat. This ability would probably be best for an archer but even if Kael were to be a swordsman it could help by sniffing out his enemies weak point's precisely. It also has potential applications beyond combat. It can be useful in any situation where accuracy and focus are needed. With training, Kael could develop this ability even further, perhaps to see things at great distances or even detect minute details others might miss." he was talking to my parents thinking that I wouldn't understand but I understood everything he said and I was already thinking of what to do with this ability. I didn't want to be an archer after all supporting wasn't my strong suit back home, I had been a frontline guy, so I was thinking of being a swordsman although it wouldn't be a bad idea to learn archery as well.</p>
<p>My father after processing what he had heard, nodded and said, "We'll ensure he receives the best training available. Thank you, Doctor."</p>

<p>Huh?? what had he meant by that, there was no way they could afford to give me the best training we weren't struggling with money but if they bought me a tutor they would probably spend at least 5 silver coins a month and I'm sure we only have 10 or so gold coins right now which would probably be like 100 silver coins and if I learn for at least 2 years that will be more than hundred silver coins. Oh right Yeah I forgot they would probably earn the same amount of money in 2 or 1 years. Huh.. it seemed like the lessons of calculations that Ela had tutored me on helped me with this calculation I wasn't bright with calculations in my past life. Well let's leave that to my parents.</p>

<p>------</p>

<p>Back at home, the atmosphere was celebratory. My sister, Ela, was particularly excited about my ability after my parents briefed her about it. "Wow, Kael! You're going to be so cool! You can hit anything with perfect accuracy! Maybe you could become a famous adventurer or even a knight!"</p>

<p>I smiled at her enthusiasm. The idea of becoming an adventurer was appealing after all I thought of it as my passion but that will probably have to wait at least 10 or 15 years. For now I wanted to understand more about my ability and experience emotions as much as I can.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, my father began teaching me more about the world and its history(although I knew about them already) while my mother had went somewhere saying that she would find me a teacher. Its been 3 days since she left.</p>

<p>My father continued explaining about his past experiences as an adventurer and said that if I became an adventurer I should ask him advice if I was ever in trouble.</p>

<p>That evening a carriage pulled up at our house. I was outside throwing rocks trying to hit birds(an old habit of mine) and I had thrown three and all three had hit the birds where I had wanted to hit them, that's when I saw the carriage. It's door opened, out of it came my mother with one other person. I couldn't make out if it was a man or a woman because they were wearing some kind of armor but it seemed the person was a knight who ever it was. I thought that this was probably who will be my teacher since that was why my mother had set out.</p>

<p>"Oh hey Kael, mommy is back with your new teacher" she said as she picked me up very easily. Oh yeah I am a child right now, aren't I? As she hold me she said "Well say hi to your teacher, she is my sister ,Bett Lucidea. She is a knight in the kingdom around here and she is a good swordsman." as my mother said that the knight before me or simply my aunt, took of her helmet and her gloves and smiled at me warmly.</p>

<p>"Hello Kael, I'm your aunt Bett and I'm here to be your teacher" she said still smiling at me. She looked a lot like my mother, she had the same hair color and eye color but she was a little taller than my mother and a better physique than my mother(probably my father too).</p>

<p>I replied as I thought that a normal kid would reply. "Hello auntie, I am Kael Ashford" as I said that some kind of feeling ran through my spine, I didn't know that it was embarrassment until some time later.</p> 

<p>As so that night my mom told my dad that she had brought Bett to be my tutor and my dad accepted it happily and so did my sister and as so my aunt, Bett became my tutor.</p>
