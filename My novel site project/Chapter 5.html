    <h2 align="center">CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p>Time passed by quickly and my fifth birth day arrived quickly. As I had metioned before the fifth, tenth and fifteenth birthday of a person in this world are hold in high regard, marking one’s growth.I half-expected some grand gesture or surprise from my family, but the day started out like any other day. No special celebrations, no hints of a surprise—just another day of training with my aunt, Bett. I wondered if they had forgotten or if they were simply waiting for the right moment. </p>        

<p>Bett had once mentioned that my actual combat training would begin when I turned five, but today, our routine hadn’t changed at all.</p>

<p>The only difference was that Ela had joined us. She hadn’t trained with us in nearly a year. After mastering the basics and learning to channel mana into a sword, she had started training independently, focusing on incorporating mana into other weapons. Her main focus had been the staff Dad gifted her on her fifth birthday.</p>

<p>We started training like usual, starting with the basics—footwork, stance, balance—and then moved on to swing and stab practice. This continued for about an hour, the familiar rhythm of our training a comforting constant.</p>

<p>"Well, that’s enough for the basics," Bett said, her voice stopping our movements. "Since Ela is joining us today, we’ll do some sparring."</p>

<p>Sparring huh? It’s been a long time since I sparred with anyone-almost six years,infact. In my past life I didn’t really hold back when sparring and no one was a match for me then. But now, my body is one of a five year old and I will be sparring with a sword not with fists. Although I trained with the sword more than Ela, I wasn’t sure I would be able to win, after all she can use magic with her sword.</p>  

<p>"So here are the rules," Bett continued. "The first person touched by the other’s sword loses."</p>

<p>Alright, so it’s all about speed and reflexes. If I can dodge her attacks, I might stand a chance. The only problem is if she uses those long-range mana attacks. Last year, it took her a while to channel mana, even if she improved the best she can do is cut the time it took by half. so I could probably strike before she finishes. And with my ability, I can close the distance quickly. But then again, this is my sister we’re talking about. No one in their right mind would hurt their sister, right? Though this world operates on different principles than the one I knew.</p>

<p>"Ready? Start!" Bett’s voice signaled the beginning of the spar.</p>

<p>As expected, Ela assumed the stance she used last year when channeling mana into her sword. She held her sword horizontally in front of her with both hands, and I could see mana beginning to gather around her legs. I charged, hoping to exploit the time it would take for her to complete the process. But as I swung, my sword met nothing but air—Ela had already dodged.</p>

<p>I quickly turned to where she had moved, only to find her sword already blazing with mana. Her mana flared into fiery flames, and with a swift, unfamiliar footwork, she unleashed a blazing arc of fire straight at me. She swung her sword five times, each strike sending a flame hurtling toward me at blistering speed.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I managed to dodge the first three flames, thanks to my ability slowing them down—a new feature I hadn’t noticed before. The fourth flame, I attempted to deflect with my sword, but the force sent it flying from my grip. The fifth flame struck true, slamming into my stomach with a force that knocked the wind out of me.</p>

<p>I braced for the impact, expecting to be thrown back, but it was all a clever diversion. The fifth strike didn’t have the same force as 
it’s predecessors and in a flash, Ela’s wooden sword tapped my side, sealing my defeat.</p>

<p>I knew it would be a challenge, but I hadn’t expected to lose—not like this. Despite my greater experience, her blend of skill and magic had bested me. The realization struck me hard—if I didn’t adapt, anyone with magic would have the upper hand as I grew. This match proved it: without mana, I’d be left struggling. I’d have to train harder than everyone else or I would risk being left behind.</p>

<p>As these thoughts raced through my mind, I found myself lying on the ground, my legs giving out from the sudden exhaustion that overtook me. The toll of using my ability was hitting me hard. I wasn’t sure why, but it seemed my young, undeveloped body struggled to handle it. Maybe that’s why the doctor insisted I hone this ability from an early age.</p>

<p>"Well, that was a good match, wasn’t it, Kael?" Ela said, her voice bright with satisfaction. She offered her hand to help me up, her face practically glowing with pride.</p>

<p>She was beaming, clearly proud of herself for pulling off those impressive moves. Right, those moves she did after infusing her sword with mana—what exactly was that? I took her hand and stood, the question already forming in my mind.</p>

<p>"Master, what were those moves Ela did at the end? You never taught me anything like that," I asked, turning to my aunt—now 'Master' after all our time together. Though we weren’t particularly close, she was someone I held dear.</p>


<p>My aunt walked over to where Ela stood, gently patting her head. With a proud smile, she looked at me and said, "Oh, that’s something I taught your sister in the first few weeks of training—the Fire Sword Style. It’s one of the four sword styles. Although I only thought her the basic forms and footwork, she trained on her own"</p>

<p>Four sword styles? Where have I heard that before? I wondered, trying to recall. Then it hit me—there was a book I’d found while reading through the collection in our house. Its title was The Four Sword Styles. I remembered being intrigued, but I hadn’t read it because it mentioned that these styles were meant for people with mana mostly battle mages—mages who wield a weapon instead of a staff. The four styles were: The fire sword style, the water sword style, the wind sword style and the earth sword style. They were based of the four main types of magic: fire, water, wind and earth. I knew they had different features but because I didn't read the book I didn't know them.</p>

<p>"Your sister here has already learned two of the styles—the fire style and the wind style. It's quite the achievement, after all the average swordsman can only learn only one of the styles and she learned two at such a young age and without being a swordsman. She could be considered a genius. Though she still got a long way until she masters them." my aunt said, a note of pride evident in her voice, clearly pleased with her student's progress.</p>

<p>Quite the achievement indeed. I had also read that it is hard to learn these styles and that even the best swordsman of this generation can only learn and master up to three of these styles. The book clearly stated that there was only one person that had mastered this four styles, one of the old 'JADES' that fought in the historic fight 2000 years ago. Legendary Sword master, 'Arkengo Bladewraith'. He was a half human and half demon and supposedly died some time after the fight. He was rumored to be the one that made the four sword styles and the third strongest from the 10 Jades.</p>

<p>The book had also stated that a person with weak determination can't learn these styles and should give up if they didn't have determination. All these information was in the introduction part of the book so I hadn't got to deep in the book, but it may have been interesting to read about it. It seems since I came to this world I got a hobby of reading. I'm not complaining though, this world's history is really interesting.</p>

<p>This thought's made me wonder how many styles does my aunt know. I deduced she knew the fire and wind styles because she wouldn't be able to teach another person what she didn't know but I wanted to know if she knew the others so I instinctively asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I clearly know the fire and wind styles and I know some of the basics of the other two but, because I had learned fire and wind styles first, it will be hard to learn the other two cuz they are the total opposite of the other two. It may take hundreds of years and if you are not from the other 4 species, it would be hard to learn the total opposite of a style you have mastered"</p>

<p>Oh that makes sense. The opposite of fire is water and the opposite of wind is earth, so it makes sense it will be hard to learn the opposite of what you have learned before. That is considering that the forms and footwork are also fully opposite of each other.</p>

<p>"Is it possible to learn this styles without having mana because they are just forms and footwork?" I asked, wanting to know if I may be able to learn it.</p>

<p>Bett put her right hand under her chin and said, "Hmmmm....., I'm not sure. There is no person I know of that learned this styles without having mana but, it may be possible to learn the forms and footwork and use it with other fighting styles"</p>

<p>Oh so that meant it wasn't hopeless. I don't know what to call it but I had an urge to learn this styles so I am just going to try to study and try to find a way to learn the forms and footwork of the styles everyday starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just like that, we sparred a little more in which I lost all of them(I felt disappointment for the first time) and that was how the training of today ended. I was actually surprised that neither of them mentioned my birthday even once and I was even more surprised that neither my parents saw us once while we were training after all, they typically watch me for sometime before going to work or somewhere else.</p>

<hr>

<p>Night approached and I was alone in the living room of our family. I started reading the first few pages of the book, "The four sword styles" to pass time and I found some info about the styles.</p>

<p>Each of the four styles have long ranged attacks like the one Ela used on me earlier today. Other than that they all have distinctive features. The fire style uses sharp moves that uses diversion's and fire magic. The wind style is mainly agility and it uses wind magic to accelerate speed. Their is also a combination of the fire style and wind style. Although it is just one move it is a very strong one. Using wind magic to accelerate yourself and then combining the footwork of the fire style and the wind style and it causes a move called ignite, which is literally making fire stronger using wind. It is mostly used for long ranged attacks though.</p>

<p>Water style uses smooth footwork and it uses water magic for mobility. Earth style uses slow movements but stronger moves, you need to work on your strength to use this style. If it manages to touch you, it would be very critical. It also can be used to change the landscape. Although that can be done using normal earth magic, with the strength you build up to be able to learn this style, it is a little more effective.</p>

<p>This was enough to know what your opponent's style would be, but these style's had different footwork so memorizing them would be good for me to counter their attacks, or just dodge.</p>

<p>I put the book down not wanting to get to much into detail and some time after I did, my parent's came back. It was already night and I haven't see them all day so I wondered where they had gone to. As they got in, I saw that they were holding a lot of things. My mom had ingredients to make food while my dad had a box and was helping my mom with the groceries as well.</p> 

<p>They hurriedly went to the kitchen like trying not to notify me that they had arrived but I had already noticed them.</p>

<p>An hour or so later, my parents, my sister and my aunt called out to me. Oh I see what it is. I went to the kitchen where we also eat our meals and I saw that a lot of food had been prepared. You could probably call it a feast. Hmm, maybe because Ela's tenth birthday is also approaching we are gonna celebrate together. After all there was no way that all of this would be just for my birthday, right?</p>

<p>Well that wasn't the case. This was really just for me. I had speculated that they were trying to surprise me or that they forgot but because I really didn't care if it was my birthday or not but it seems the right answer was the former one and I had found out that as soon as I entered because I was greeted with a loud, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY".</p>

<p>As they said that, I kind of felt some kind of relief come over me. It seems I really didn't want them to forget about my birthday. After all this was one of the milestones of this life.</p>

<p>That night we celebrated my birthday and I felt a huge satisfaction. I also got some gifts. My parents and Ela gave me some kind of cape and they said it was resistant to fire magic. My aunt gave me a real sword. Although it was short, it was good enough for my body right now. I was happy with this life. It wasn't perfect by any means but I had a caring family who loved me, which I didn't have before. I could feel emotions, something I had never felt in my past life. And other things as well. I deemed that everyone who was with me tonight was someone who I had to protect with all my strength. They are people that matter to me.</p>


<p>Oh, so this was what my wife in my past life wanted. For me to care for her and my kids as I cared for the people that are with me here. A regretful smile came across my face. If I had another chance with them, would have I cared for them as much as they wanted me too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Fast forward two years and a lot of things happened. There were three most notable things.</p>

<p>The first being, that I found a way to learn the four sword styles even though I still haven't started it. </p>

<p>The second was that Ela's tenth birthday in which she decided to go to a magic school to hone her skills. My father said that if she went to a magic school, she should go to the best one, Thaloria magic school, in the kingdom of Thaloria. This kingdom was one of the main nation's of the central continent. There were two others, Arcanum and Celestia.</p> 

<p>My father had also attended the Thaloria magic school when he was young and he graduated top of the school. One of his closest friends then had now become the principal of the magic school so, my father wrote a recommendation later. The trip from Thaloria to Rivenwood was 4 months and that was in the shortest route so Ela had to wait for about a year to know if she had been admitted. Then just last week we got a letter saying that she had been admitted. So she wanted to leave as soon as possible, which brings us to the last thing that happened in the past two years.</p>

<p>The third was that my aunt and master, Bett, deciding that she will leave Rivenwood to look for someone she love. She said that she was influenced by what she had seen with my parents love and wanted to find someone who would be a partner for her. My parents had agreed with her for a five year deal when she first became my teacher but, now that she wanted to leave, they asked her to take Ela to Thaloria then, she can do what she want and she agreed.</p>

<p>This was a week ago as well. And now, the preparation's has been set and they were ready to leave. I was a little sad that two people I cared for were leaving but, I knew it was for their own good so I didn't complain. But still, this child mind of mines seemed to be still of a child and started crying as soon as they were going to leave.</p>

<p>"Don't worry it's not like you won't meet them again" said my mother trying to stop my crying. Hey I didn't want to cry, its just my mind and emotions.</p>

<p>"I will come back after I finish my studies, but sorry I won't be able to come to your tenth birthday" said my sister hugging me</p>

<p>"And I promise to come for your tenth birthday" said my aunt, hugging me as well.</p>

<p>It was a little sad that the two of them would be gone for so long especially Ela after all the normal time a student studies in Thaloria's magic school is five years. I would still meet my aunt after 3 years though, that was worth looking forward to.</p>

<p>"Don't neglect your training" both of them said before going away. They still had a four month trip ahead of them.</p>

<p>As so two people from my family went away and the only one's left were me and my parents. I had made a goal to train with the forms and footwork of the four sword styles for the next three years so I can become stronger and try to be an adventurer.</p>
