        <h2 align="center">CHAPTER 6</h2>
        <p>Some weeks passed since Ela and my aunt left for the kingdom of Thaloria. In these past weeks, I was training on the forms and footwork of the four sword styles. Although I had memorized all the forms and footwork during the past two years, executing them was no easy task. The first style I wanted to learn was the water style; this was because I had experienced the power of the fire style firsthand and I wanted to have an idea of how to counter it. But there was another reason as well. The water style was mainly composed of smooth footwork, and as such, I thought it would be beneficial for my ability. The thing was, my ability is mostly used to deal a critical hit on an opponent, and since I wasn’t using a bow as my main weapon, long-ranged attacks were out of the question. So if I use the smooth movements of the water style with two of my ability's features—the critical hit and the feature that slows down attacks so I can dodge them—I can inflict high damage on my opponent. A dodge and hit attack would be a good thing to have.</p>

        <p>Today, I asked my dad to help me train.</p>
        
        <p>“Sorry Kael, I was called by the adventurer’s guild. It seems like there is some kind of mission. Ahh, it has been a long time since I was called to the guild. I really need the money. Well, I will help you some other day,” he said.</p>
        
        <p>Hmm, he used to help me every day these past weeks since Ela and Bett left, but I guess he really has to go there and he seems really excited. I understand though; we have been tight on money for some time now. The house’s income mostly comes from the escort jobs that the guild gives my dad, and even though the farm work pays as well, the guild pays ten times more for one job. It has been six months since he was last called by the guild and nearly a year since he got an escort job.</p>
        
        <p>I waved goodbye to him since I understood the severity of the situation. After all, I too had worked to get money for my family, though our motives were completely different.</p>
        
        <p>I gave up on training on the styles today and probably for some time if my father got an escort job and decided to go to the village instead. After I reached five years old, my parents allowed me to go to the farm fields and the village, a privilege Ela didn’t enjoy. I’m not sure why she wasn’t allowed, but I guessed it was because they knew that my fighting skills, in this case self-defense skills, were the real deal. At my age, Ela only knew some basic magic spells and because she was also a girl, they thought she would be more prone to attack.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, I left the house and started strolling to the village. I passed by the farm and the people who knew me waved at me. I waved back, smiling. I also passed by the house of the elf doctor who told us about my ability. I had heard he just came back from the elf continent after four years of travel. He left right after he told us about my ability, but since me, there has been no one that had an ability yet, so it wasn’t really bad. And even if there were illnesses, there were also normal doctors.</p>
        
        <p>Some time after I passed by the doctor’s house, I arrived at the village. I had the sword that my aunt had gotten me on a hilt that I got sometime later, just in case.</p>
        
        <p>I went into the village, and since I had some money, I went to the shop area. The money I had was some money I had been given by my father’s colleagues in the farm. These people were the ones that had been struggling with their crops dying. Using my ability, I had solved that problem about three years ago, and it seemed that they remembered about it and gave me 5 silver coins, which were the equivalent of 50 copper coins. I had been given this money on my fifth birthday as a gift. The reason why they gave me money instead of a gift was that they didn’t know what I would want, so they just gave the money to me. They seemed to be good people, so I would occasionally help them in the farm. They would ask me to stop, but I would give them a false reason that my master asked me to help them as a form of training.</p>
        
        <p>I went into the shop area and started looking around. I have only come here once. It was when I was a baby and when my mother took me out to get some things for Ela’s fifth birthday. If I remember correctly, this sword, the hilt, and the fire-resistant robe my parents got me for my fifth birthday were all bought here. Since I wanted to know if there were other ways to handle a sword excluding the four sword styles and without using mana, I went to a nearby book shop.</p>
        
        <p>I went into the shop, but after skimming around a bit, I got out without buying anything. There were two reasons for that. The first was that I didn’t find the book I was looking for, and the second was that the books in this shop were all one gold or more. I asked the shopkeeper if there were any books less than half a gold (one gold is ten silver and one hundred copper), but he said that every book in the shop area was more than one gold and in some rare chances it would be one gold. He also told me that if I went to more civilized places than Rivenwood, like the Bell Kingdom, two months from here, the lowest priced book I would find would be two gold.</p>
        
        <p>As such, I gave up on trying to find any books and looked around for other things. I looked at weapons, armory, and other stuff, but they were also not in my budget, so I couldn’t buy them. I looked around a little more in the armor shop and found some gloves. It was in the swordsman section and I thought that they were for swordsmen to handle their swords. I saw the price, and it was two silver coins. I thought it would help me while training and in the future as well, so I bought it.</p>
        
        <p>I moved around the shop area a little more, and except for food, I couldn’t find anything that was less than three silver coins, which was my current budget after buying the gloves. Ultimately, I couldn’t buy what I wanted to buy at first, which was books and other things as well, and I returned home with my gloves.</p>
        
        <p>As I was returning from the village, I saw the elf doctor carrying a huge bag in which I thought he was going on another trip. It was weird that he was going away just after returning. If what I heard was right, he only just came back from his last trip a week ago. He seemed to be in a hurry, and before I could even greet him, he went off running.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe a carriage to his location is going to set off now, I thought.</p>
        
        <p>A little later, I passed by the farm. I like to sit here and just watch the sky sometimes, another habit of mine I picked up in this world after reading. There was some time before sunset, so I decided to sit there for a while. I stayed there for like thirty minutes or so and started heading home.</p>
        
        <p>After some walking, I could see my house. As I got a little closer, I could hear a conversation from our house. I made sure that nobody saw me and got a little closer. I could deduce the sounds were coming from the front door, so I hid in a bush near our house. I actually realized that this was the first time I had seen this bush. Anyways, I tried seeing who was talking to whom, but the door covered them. The only thing I could do was hear their voices. I heard two familiar voices, both were my parents.</p>
        
        <p>From what I could hear, my parents weren’t arguing.</p>
        
        <p>“Are you sure about this?”</p>
        
        <p>“When do you think they will arrive on this continent?”</p>
        
        <p>My father and mother asked respectively. From this, I thought if there was another person in this conversation.</p>
        
        <p>“Yes, I am sure about it, and sorry, but I don’t know when they will arrive here. But if I have to guess, it will take six or so years. After all, even if the vampire race is one of the strongest demon races, taking control of an entire continent would take a lot of time. Even then, they will travel through the central continent to get here. Although I guessed six years, it may as well take ten years to get here,”</p>
        
        <p>At the response of the person, I could hear my parents breathe a sigh of relief. By the way, the voice of the person seemed familiar, but I couldn’t make out who it was.</p>
        
        <p>“Well, thanks for informing us about this, my dear friend. Hope you have a safe trip,”</p>
        
        <p>As my father said that, I started thinking about people who were close with my father, but I couldn’t think of a lot of people who were that close to my father.</p>
        
        <p>After that, my parents closed the door and the man stood there. Oh, it’s him. Because the door was closed, I could see who my parents were talking to; it was the elf doctor from before. Yeah, if I recall correctly, my father and this guy had traveled together for some time. But anyway, what was that about vampires and taking control of the continent.</p>
        <p>As I wondered about that, the doctor went running on his way and as for me, I got out of the bush and went into the house wondering about this conversation I just heard.</p>

        <p>Although my parent’s tried to hide it, I could see their faces were a little gloomy. I decided not to ask them about it and just went to sleep.</p>
